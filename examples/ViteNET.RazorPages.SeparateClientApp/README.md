# ViteNET

This is an example project to show how to use Vite with ASP.NET Razor Pages, using a separate directory for the Vite client application.

## How to run

The project is already configured to install the npm dependencies and run vite. So, simply run the ASP.NET application by running `dotnet run` or pressing `F5` in Visual Studio.
